# YokaiHunt - Spawn and Battle Mechanics Update

## Overview
This update implements balanced Pokemon spawning based on trainer level and realistic turn-based battle mechanics with proper damage calculation and type effectiveness.

---

## 🎯 Key Features Implemented

### 1. **Spawn Balancing**

#### Rarity Distribution (Weighted Probability)
- **Common**: 60% spawn rate (Pidgey, Rattata, Caterpie, etc.)
- **Uncommon**: 25% spawn rate
- **Rare**: 10% spawn rate
- **Epic**: 4% spawn rate
- **Legendary/Mythic**: 1% spawn rate

#### Trainer Level Requirements
- **Level 1-19**: Cannot encounter Legendary/Mythic Pokemon
- **Level ≥ 20**: Legendary Pokemon (Mewtwo, Lugia, Rayquaza, etc.) can spawn with < 0.5% chance
- Common Pokemon appear more frequently for low-level trainers
- Spawn quality gradually improves with trainer level

#### Spawn Density
- **7-8 active Pokemon** visible per 10×10 grid area at any time
- Pokemon level scales with trainer level (±1-3 level variance)
- Legendary Pokemon spawn at +5 levels above base
- Spawn duration varies by rarity (Legendary: 90s, Epic: 75s, Common: 60s)

---

### 2. **Battle Mechanics**

#### Turn-Based System
- Proper turn alternation between player and opponent
- Battle state management prevents overlapping actions
- Player can only act during their turn

#### Pokemon Switching
- New **"Switch Pokemon"** button in battle UI
- Shows current team with HP status
- Fainted Pokemon cannot be selected
- Opponent attacks after player switches (maintains turn-based flow)

#### Damage Calculation
Uses the canonical Pokemon damage formula:
```
damage = (((2 × level / 5 + 2) × power × (attack / defense)) / 50 + 2) × modifiers
```

**Modifiers include:**
- Type effectiveness (×0, ×0.5, ×2, ×4)
- Random factor (0.85 - 1.0)
- Physical vs Special attack/defense stats

---

### 3. **Type Effectiveness Chart**

Complete type chart implementation based on canonical Pokemon:
- **Super Effective**: ×2 damage (e.g., Fire vs Grass)
- **Not Very Effective**: ×0.5 damage (e.g., Water vs Grass)
- **Immune**: ×0 damage (e.g., Normal vs Ghost)
- Multiple types stack multiplicatively (e.g., ×4 damage possible)

#### Example Type Matchups
- Fire → Grass: **×2** (Super Effective)
- Water → Fire: **×2** (Super Effective)
- Electric → Ground: **×0** (Immune)
- Grass → Fire: **×0.5** (Not Very Effective)

---

### 4. **Battle UI Improvements**

#### Floating Damage Text
- Shows **"-XX HP"** above damaged Pokemon
- Displays type effectiveness messages:
  - "It's super effective!"
  - "It's not very effective..."
  - "No effect!"
- Text animates upward and fades out

#### Real-Time HP Bars
- Color-coded by health:
  - **Green**: > 50% HP
  - **Yellow**: 20-50% HP
  - **Red**: < 20% HP
- Updates instantly after each attack
- Shows numerical HP values

#### Battle State Display
- Clear indication of whose turn it is
- Battle action buttons disabled during animations
- Status messages for all battle events

---

### 5. **Trainer Progression System**

#### Experience & Leveling
- XP awarded after every victory based on:
  - Wild Pokemon level
  - Base experience stat
- Formula: `EXP = (base_experience × wild_level) / 7`

#### Level Calculation
- Pokemon-style cubic progression
- Formula: `Level = floor((totalXP / 100)^(1/3)) + 1`
- Each level requires progressively more XP

#### Persistence
- **MongoDB Storage**:
  - `trainerLevel`: Current trainer level
  - `experience`: XP in current level
  - `totalExperience`: Cumulative XP
  - `battlesWon` / `battlesLost`: Win/loss record

#### Backend API Endpoints
- `POST /api/player/add-experience`: Award XP and handle level-ups
- `GET /api/player/progress/:playerId`: Retrieve trainer stats

---

### 6. **Debug Overlay**

Real-time debugging interface showing:

#### Trainer Info
- Current trainer level
- Experience progress (current / next level)
- Total battles won

#### Active Spawns
- Pokemon name with color-coded rarity
- Pokemon level
- Distance from player (in pixels)

#### Battle Damage Rolls
- Last attacker name
- Damage dealt
- Type effectiveness result

**Toggle**: Press the debug button (bottom-left) to show/hide

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Spawn System
```typescript
// Create spawn manager with trainer level
const spawnManager = new SpawnManager(scene, tileSize, mapWidth, mapHeight, trainerLevel);

// Update trainer level dynamically
spawnManager.setTrainerLevel(newLevel);
```

### Battle Damage
```typescript
import { calculateDamage } from './typeEffectiveness';

const result = calculateDamage(
  attackerLevel,
  movePower,
  attackStat,
  defenseStat,
  moveType,
  defenderTypes
);

// result = { damage: 42, effectiveness: 2.0, effectivenessText: "It's super effective!" }
```

### Type Effectiveness
```typescript
import { getTypeEffectiveness } from './typeEffectiveness';

const multiplier = getTypeEffectiveness('fire', ['grass', 'bug']);
// Returns 4.0 (super effective against both types)
```

### Trainer Progression (Backend)
```javascript
// Award experience
POST /api/player/add-experience
Body: { playerId: 1, experience: 150 }

// Response
{
  "success": true,
  "leveledUp": true,
  "oldLevel": 5,
  "newLevel": 6,
  "totalExperience": 1350,
  "experienceToNextLevel": 450
}
```

## 🔧 Integration Notes

### Frontend Integration
To integrate with your Game component:

```tsx
import DebugOverlay from './components/DebugOverlay';

const [debugVisible, setDebugVisible] = useState(false);
const [trainerLevel, setTrainerLevel] = useState(1);

// In Phaser config
const gameConfig = {
  // ... other config
  trainerLevel: trainerLevel,
  onSpawnsUpdate: (spawns) => {
    // Update debug overlay with spawn data
  }
};

// In render
<>
  <PhaserGame config={gameConfig} />
  <DebugOverlay
    trainerLevel={trainerLevel}
    experience={experience}
    experienceToNext={expToNext}
    battlesWon={battlesWon}
    spawns={spawns}
    isVisible={debugVisible}
    onToggle={() => setDebugVisible(!debugVisible)}
  />
</>
```

### Backend Routes
Add these routes to your Express server:

```javascript
import { addExperience, getPlayerProgress } from './controllers/playerController.js';

app.post('/api/player/add-experience', addExperience);
app.get('/api/player/progress/:playerId', getPlayerProgress);
```

## 🎯 Balance Testing

### Recommended Testing Scenarios

1. **Low Level (1-5)**
   - Should only see Common/Uncommon Pokemon
   - Pokemon levels 1-7
   - No legendary encounters

2. **Mid Level (10-15)**
   - Mix of Common/Uncommon/Rare
   - Pokemon levels 8-18
   - Occasional Epic spawns

3. **High Level (20+)**
   - All rarities including Legendary
   - Pokemon levels 18-25+
   - Legendary spawn rate < 0.5%

4. **Type Effectiveness**
   - Fire vs Grass = ×2 damage (Super Effective)
   - Water vs Fire = ×2 damage
   - Electric vs Ground = ×0 damage (Immune)

5. **Battle Mechanics**
   - Turn-based flow works correctly
   - Switching Pokemon triggers opponent attack
   - Floating text appears and fades
   - HP bars update in real-time

## 🐛 Known Limitations

1. **Move Database**: Only 20+ moves included. Expand as needed.
2. **AI Behavior**: Wild Pokemon use basic type-based moves. Could be enhanced with smarter move selection.
3. **Team Management**: Pokemon team must be passed to battle. Ensure team data structure matches expected format.

---
